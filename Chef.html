 Saul started his culinary journey at 17 as a dishwasher at IHOP, worked his 
way up to cook, and felt inspired to attend culinary school, where he graduated
at the top of his class. Through his work, he learned the importance of
‘mise en place’, a French culinary phrase which means ‘everything in its place’,
and dedicated himself to becoming a lifelong learner in the culinary world.
                
 From catering work to running a restaurant, Saul has now turned his focus to
sustainability and adapting classical techniques to embrace the ‘modern kitchen’.
He helped open UTK, and is now Chef de Cuisine at The Garden. His love of healthy
living and fresh ingredients straight from our garden serves as constant inspiration
for his menu ideas and daily specials.
